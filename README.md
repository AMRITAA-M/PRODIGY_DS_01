# PRODIGY_DS_01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

In this task, we analyzed two datasets related to population distribution: one focusing on gender distribution and the other on age distribution. The gender distribution dataset contained population counts for males and females across different years. We visualized this data using a bar chart, where the x-axis represented the year and the y-axis represented the population count for both genders. This allowed us to compare the male and female populations over time effectively. Similarly, the age distribution dataset provided population counts for different age groups. To analyze this, we used Seabornâ€™s bar plot, applying a distinct color palette and adding grid styling for better readability. The x-axis displayed various age groups, while the y-axis represented the population count. Additionally, x-axis labels were rotated to enhance clarity. These visualizations helped in understanding demographic trends, identifying variations in gender populations over time, and examining how different age groups contributed to the overall population distribution
